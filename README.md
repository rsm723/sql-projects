# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository contains SQL queries and data analysis projects that I have worked on. Each project involves real-world data and demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and extract insights using SQL.

## 📌 Projects

### 1️⃣ Manhattan Rent Prices 🏙️  
**Objective:** Analyzing rental trends across different neighborhoods in Manhattan.  
**Skills Used:** Data cleaning, aggregation, window functions, and filtering.  
**Key Insights:**  
- Identified neighborhoods with the highest and lowest rental prices.  
- Analyzed price trends over time to determine seasonality.  
- Used `AVG()`, `RANK()`, and `JOINs` to compare different apartment sizes.
